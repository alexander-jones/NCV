By developing large computational models of the brain, scientists can simulate how neurons interact with each other to give rise to mental faculties. While a few publicly available brain simulation platforms exist, few are capable of launching large scale simulations without requiring expensive hardware configurations. The [Neocortical Simulator (NCS)](http://www.cse.unr.edu/brain/ncs) developed by the Brain Computation Laboratory at UNR utilizes distributed CPU & GPU resources to spread the computation load across multiple machines; allowing for large scale brain simulation with limited hardware investment. In addition, NCS contains a plug-in framework which allows for easy integration of computational neuron models. \r\n\r\n### What is NCV?\r\nNeocortical View is a cross platform application that provides an easy to use graphical interface to interact with the [Neocortical Simulator (NCS)](http://www.cse.unr.edu/brain/ncs) and provides helpful tools for analysing the state of brain simulations in real time. NCV also includes a plug-in framework that can be utilized to easily extend it's functionality and allow further expansions to NCS to be incorporated easily. \r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\n### Toolkits\r\nThis software was developed for the Senior Projects (CS 426) course at UNR in Spring of 2013.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
