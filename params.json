While a few publicly available brain simulation platforms exist, few are capable of launching large\r\nscale simulations without requiring expensive hardware configurations. The [Neocortical Simulator (NCS)](http://www.cse.unr.edu/brain/ncs)\r\ndeveloped by the Brain Computation Laboratory at UNR utilizes distributed CPU & GPU resources to spread the computation load\r\nacross multiple machines; allowing for large scale brain simulation with limited hardware investment. In addition, NCS contains\r\na plug-in framework which allows for easy integration of computational neuron models.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is NCV?\r\nNeocortical View is a cross platform application that provides an easy to use graphical interface to interact with the\r\n[Neocortical Simulator (NCS)](http://www.cse.unr.edu/brain/ncs) and provides helpful tools for analysing the state of brain\r\nsimulations in real time. NCV also includes a plug-in framework that can be utilized to easily extend it's functionality and\r\nallow further expansions to NCS to be incorporated easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This software was developed for the Senior Projects (CS 426) course at UNR in Spring of 2013.*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
