          <h3>Overview</h3>

<p>For neuroscientists, understanding the physiological processes that facilitate memory, learning, and cognition is paramount. By developing large computational models of the brain, scientists can simulate how neurons interact with each other to give rise to mental faculties. While a few publicly available brain simulation platforms exist, few are capable of launching large scale simulations without requiring expensive hardware configurations. The <a href="http://www.cse.unr.edu/brain/ncs">Neocortical Simulator (NCS)</a> developed by the Brain Computation Laboratory at UNR utilizes distributed CPU &amp; GPU resources to spread the computation load across multiple machines; allowing for large scale brain simulation with limited hardware investment. In addition, NCS contains a plug-in framework which allows for easy integration of computational neuron models. </p>

<h3>What is NCV?</h3>

<p>Neocortical View is a cross platform application that provides an easy to use graphical interface to interact with the <a href="http://www.cse.unr.edu/brain/ncs">Neocortical Simulator (NCS)</a> and provides helpful tools for analysing the state of brain simulations in real time. NCV also includes a plug-in framework that can be utilized to easily extend it's functionality and allow further expansions to NCS to be incorporated easily. </p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
